Hi there! I'm a 4th year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. [Chun Jason Xue](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~jasonxue/) at CityU and  Prof. [Tei-Wei Kuo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gBuHlIQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at National Taiwan University. 

My research interests lie in building next-generation data compression algorithms and systems (e.g. combined with neural networks), neural-network acceleration, and edge computing.

**I'm on the job market this year. Feel free to contact me &#128516;**
